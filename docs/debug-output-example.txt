BudBridge Debug Output Example
==============================

This shows example debug output from the iOS app when connected to the Windows PC.

Key observations from this session:
- iOS running at 24kHz, mono
- Receiving ~100 packets/sec from PC (~48KB/sec)
- Sending ~40 packets/sec to PC (~48KB/sec)
- Audio is mostly silence (maxAmp: 1-2) - need actual audio playing on PC
- Player is running and scheduling buffers correctly

--- What to look for ---

1. "Non-zero samples" should be high (thousands) when actual audio is playing
2. "maxAmp" should be much higher than 1-2 when audio is playing (e.g., 1000+)
3. "Player playing: true" confirms the audio engine is running
4. Preview hex should show varied values, not mostly 00 00

--- Troubleshooting ---

If maxAmp is always 1-2:
- Windows isn't capturing actual audio
- Make sure Stereo Mix is set as default recording device
- Play some audio on Windows to test

If Player playing: false:
- Audio engine stopped (interruption, route change)
- Check for "Audio engine stopped" in logs

If RX packets are 0:
- Network issue
- Check firewall on Windows (UDP ports 4810, 4811)
- Ensure both devices on same network
